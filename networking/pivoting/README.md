# Pivoting in Red Teaming/Offensive Security 

Pivoting is a critical concept in the field of red teaming and offensive security.  
It refers to the technique of leveraging access to one compromised system to move deeper into a target network.  
This process is also known as "lateral movement" and is essential for simulating real-world attacks during penetration tests or red team engagements.  

## Key Aspects of Pivoting 
 
1. **Initial Access** :
  - The process begins by compromising an initial host or system within the target network, often referred to as the "foothold."
 
2. **Network Exploration** :
  - After gaining access to the foothold, attackers enumerate the network to discover additional systems, resources, or services that can be targeted.
 
3. **Movement** :
  - Pivoting involves using the compromised system as a relay to exploit other machines or systems within the internal network.  
    This allows attackers to bypass perimeter defenses and access systems that would otherwise be inaccessible from the outside.
 
1. **Techniques** : 
  - **Port Forwarding** : Redirecting traffic from the attacker's machine through the compromised host to the target system.
 
  - **Proxy Chains** : Setting up a series of proxies to obfuscate and route traffic through multiple systems.
 
  - **Tunneling** : Creating encrypted tunnels (e.g., SSH or VPN) to securely send and receive data while traversing the network.
 
  - **Credential Harvesting and Reuse** : Capturing and using credentials found on the compromised system to authenticate with other machines.
 
5. **Purpose** :
  - The ultimate goal of pivoting is to gain access to high-value systems, such as domain controllers, databases, or critical applications, which often reside deeper within the network.

## Importance in Offensive Security 

Pivoting simulates the methods used by real-world attackers to escalate access within a network. By employing pivoting during red team engagements, organizations can:

- Identify weak points in network segmentation and security.

- Test detection and response capabilities against lateral movement.

- Gain insights into how attackers could traverse their environment.

By understanding and practicing pivoting techniques, security teams can better prepare for and defend against advanced threats.
