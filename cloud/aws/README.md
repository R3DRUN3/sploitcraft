# OFFENSIVE SECURITY FOR AMAZON WEB SERVICES  

[*Amazon Web Services*](https://aws.amazon.com) (AWS) is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud computing platform provided by Amazon.  
It offers a vast array of services, including computing power, storage solutions, and networking capabilities, all available on-demand with flexible pay-as-you-go pricing.  

AWS is crucial for modern infrastructure because it enables businesses of all sizes to scale and innovate quickly without the need for significant upfront capital expenditure on physical hardware.   

Its global reach, robust security features, and reliable performance make it an essential foundation for enterprises to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently, fostering agility and competitive advantage in the digital age.  

 

Given its significance, AWS has also become a prime target for various threat actors who aim to exploit vulnerabilities and/or misconfigurations and gain unauthorized access to data and services.   
These threats necessitate stringent security measures and constant vigilance to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of cloud-based operations.
