# OFFENSIVE SECURITY FOR THE CLOUD ☁️  

Cloud computing refers to the delivery of various services, such as storage, processing power, and software, over the internet rather than through local servers or personal devices.  
This technology allows for greater flexibility, scalability, reproducibility and cost-efficiency for businesses and individuals.   

Threat actors target cloud computing because it often hosts vast amounts of sensitive data, making it a lucrative target.   
Additionally, the interconnected nature of cloud services can present numerous vulnerabilities, which, if exploited, can lead to widespread and significant breaches, impacting multiple clients and services simultaneously.
