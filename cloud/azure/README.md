# OFFENSIVE SECURITY FOR AZURE

[*Azure*](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) is Microsoft's public cloud platform.  
Azure offers a large collection of services, which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and managed database service capabilities.  
Azure, like other cloud platforms, relies heavily on virtualization technologies:  
Azure is a huge collection of servers and networking hardware, which runs a complex set of distributed applications.  
These applications orchestrate the configuration and operation of virtualized hardware and software on those servers.  

Azure is crucial for modern infrastructure because it enables businesses of all sizes to scale and innovate quickly without the need for significant upfront capital expenditure on physical hardware.  

Its global reach, robust security features, and reliable performance make it an essential foundation for enterprises to build, deploy, and manage applications efficiently, fostering agility and competitive advantage in the digital age.  

 

Given its significance, Azure has also become a prime target for various threat actors who aim to exploit vulnerabilities and/or misconfigurations and gain unauthorized access to data and services.   
These threats necessitate stringent security measures and constant vigilance to protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of cloud-based operations.
