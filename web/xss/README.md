# CROSS SITE SCRIPTING

*Cross-site scripting (XSS)* is a security vulnerability found in web applications that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into webpages viewed by other users.  
This can lead to various attacks, including data theft, session hijacking, and the spread of malware.

There are three main types of XSS: Stored XSS, where the malicious script is permanently stored on the target server; Reflected XSS, where the script is reflected off a web server, such as in a search result or error message; and DOM-based XSS, where the vulnerability exists in the client-side code rather than server-side, allowing the script to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) environment.
