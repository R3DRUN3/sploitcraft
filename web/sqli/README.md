# SQL INJECTION 
*SQL Injection (SQLi)* is a security vulnerability in web applications that allows attackers to interfere with the queries an application makes to its database.  
This can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, and in some cases, administrative control over the database.  
There are several types of SQL Injection:  
 
1. **Classic SQL Injection** : This occurs when user input is not correctly sanitized, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL statements that can alter database queries.  
 
2. **Blind SQL Injection** : This type occurs when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection but the results of the injection are not visible to the attacker.  
The attacker sends payloads to the server and observes its responses to infer the structure of the database.  
 
3. **Error-based SQL Injection** : This type of injection relies on error messages thrown by the database to gather information about its structure.  
By carefully crafting input that generates database errors, an attacker can reveal details about the database schema.  
 
4. **Union-based SQL Injection** : This technique leverages the UNION SQL operator to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result, allowing attackers to retrieve data from different database tables.  

SQL Injection can have severe consequences, including data breaches, loss of data integrity, and disruption of services.  
It is essential to use parameterized queries, stored procedures, and proper input validation to mitigate SQL Injection risks.
