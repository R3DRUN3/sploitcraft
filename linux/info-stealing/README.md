# Linux Info Stealing

Linux information stealing refers to the process of extracting sensitive data from Linux-based systems, typically for malicious purposes.  This can include accessing configuration files, credentials, SSH keys, browser data, api keys, tokens, or other private information stored on the system.  
In the cybersecurity domain, studying and understanding these techniques is crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and strengthening system defenses.  
Tools designed for this purpose are often used for both ethical penetration testing and malicious attacks, emphasizing the need for robust security practices.
