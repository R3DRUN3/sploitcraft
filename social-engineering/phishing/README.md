# PHISHING

*Phishing* is a cyber attack method where attackers masquerade as legitimate entities to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details.  
This is typically done through fraudulent emails, messages, or websites that appear trustworthy and convincing.  
Phishing schemes often create a sense of urgency or fear, prompting victims to act quickly without verifying the source.  
This method is highly effective because it exploits human vulnerabilities, making it a persistent and significant threat in the realm of cybersecurity.
