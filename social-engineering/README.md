# SOCIAL ENGINEERING

Social engineering is a manipulation technique used to deceive individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.  
It exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities, often through tactics like phishing, pretexting, or baiting.   Attackers might impersonate trusted figures, create a sense of urgency, or use social pressure to achieve their goals.  
Effective social engineering preys on natural tendencies such as trust, fear, and curiosity, making it a potent tool for cybercriminals and a critical concern for cybersecurity professionals.
