# CONTAINERS OFFENSIVE SECURITY


Containers in Linux are lightweight, portable, and efficient virtualization units that allow applications  
to run consistently across different environments: they encapsulate an application and its dependencies, libraries, and configuration files into a single package  
ensuring it runs the same regardless of the host system.  
Unlike traditional virtual machines, containers share the host system's kernel but maintain isolated user spaces, which leads to faster startup times, reduced overhead, and better resource utilization.  
Popular container runtimes include `Docker`, `Podman`, `containerd` and `CRI-O`.
